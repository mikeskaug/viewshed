# Viewshed

I'm interested in the [viewshed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewshed_analysis) problem because it's relatively intuitive to explain - figuring out what is visible from a view point location - but it is not simple to compute. I first learned about viewshed analysis in the context of radio frequency propagation. Given a radio transmitter location, like a cell tower, viewshed analysis can be used to determine where the signal will propagate before being obstructed by terrain. (In reality, radio waves refract over and around obstacles, but that can be ignored for a simple estimate.)

I'm also using this as an excuse to learn [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). When I'm learning something new, I need a goal that I'm trying to accomplish other than just learning the thing. Reading, watching videos and doing exercises doesn't work for me.
